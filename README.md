# Simultaneous and Efficient Logistic Regression
The package provides functions for building regression models for ordinal and nominal multinomial response data. These include standard models such as cumulative odds models, continuation ratio models, adjacent category models, and baseline category logit models in a unified computational approach that also enables nonstandard models of arbitrary form, for example, tree based models partitioning the response categories. The theory of generalized estimating equations provides the engine for fitting the models and deriving statistical inferences. This framework also enables implementation of penalized multinomial response regression, and analysis of correlated ordinal and multinomial response data. Several published data sets are used for illustration including data from a study quantitative ultrasound biomarkers for estimating pre-term birth risk during pregnancy, data on white wine bitterness, and mental health survey data.
